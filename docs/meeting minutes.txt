- TODO: rework introduction and goals; overview of SPL Conqueror; re-read + considerations on context feature model cardinality and its purpose

- discussion on: 
	- intention and purpose of context model -> valid configuration space -> application of machine learning techniques
	- transitions between configurations do model adaptations/change of strategies
	- design paradigm separation of concerns -> policies and mechanisms 
	- current state of the system and planned extensions (take into consideration for model): 
		1. adaptation strategies 
		2. interface for mechanisms (placement, distribution, query optimization) to implement migration/placement policies
		3. location and its importance for mobile scenarios and range demand
	- ways to model constraints (exclusively graph structure/path vs additional propositional logic formulas)
	- appropriateness of context feature modeling technique, regarding coupling of context and system
	- regarding last point: can limitations be shown? if yes, possible contribution
	- ways to capture properties of placement mechanisms (-> Lakshaman,Li,Strom  paper suggests a decision tree to select a mechanism)

discussion on:
- SPLConqueror: can be used to determine the influence of feature combinations(!) on some defined system performance measure -> uncover influence of system configurations on performance of Strategies; off-line learning
- need for a model of system + context, importance of separation of these
- steps of domain engineering for a context model: 1. enumerate variable features 2. decompose/structure them in a hierarchy, restricting the configuration space this way (additional constraints possible)
- place for QoS metrics: should belong to context, as they cannot be reconfigured directly like a system feature
- possible hierarchy for context: system/global view + node/local view
- need for a way to represent cardinality and test constraints imposed by it in practice
- decision goals of the model (what decisions are governed by the modeled data (?))
