- title: specification of transitions in CEP systems using context feature models
- co-supervisor markus
- introduction: Think of a structure for the overall report. What sections you would include in background, related work, how your design, implementation sections will be structured, how do you think you will evaluate your design. 

- paper summary: rename to related work
- intro + motivation, problem description -> focus on CFM
- update goals
- context model requirements:
	- motivation for usage of bolchini framework, apropriateness
	- table to text, just most important parts as table (?)


-feature = user visible characteristic of a system… (cite FODA-Paper and generalize here for DSPL)
Introduce somewhere following wording: SPL (design time configuration of variants), Variant represented in terms of configuration,
selected Features = configuration, Runtime Adaptation -> DSPL, Adaptation Options, Adaptation Options are represented by variability model, as variability mode we employ CFM… Context-Feature (assigned by environment), System-Features (reconfigurable and depend on given context)
