Topic (English): Specification of Transitions in Complex Event Processing Systems using Context Feature Models

Goals:


Inhalt: 
- Identify properties of CFM required to represent an adaptive CEP system
- apply machine learning methods to solve the problem of context prediction in adaptive CEP system

Vorgehen: 
- Literature review on CFM in DSPLs and review of existing Adaptive CEP systems
- Analysis of adaptive CEP system to express the dynamics using CFM in DSPLs
- Implementation and evalutation of the model on existing adaptive CEP system

Herausforderungen:
- Capture dynamicity in the context features and quality demands of Adaptive CEP system using CFM
- application of machine learning methods for the state prediction problem in CEP

Zielvorgaben:
1. Literature review and analysis of CFM in DSPLs and adaptive CEP systems
2. Identify properties of CFMs required to represent an adaptive CEP system
3. Propose a concept of the CFM model for AdaptiveCEP that models contextual changes along with non-functional quality requirements to specify possible valid configurations of mechanisms for transitions
4. Design of the ML approach that automatically identifies CEP mechanisms with respect to valid context and non-functional quality requirements
5. Prototypical implementation of the designed concept over the existing AdaptiveCEP system
6. Evaluate the designed solution and compare it

1. Literature review and analysis of context feature models in dynamic software product lines and adaptive CEP systems. Document it (4 weeks)

2. Identify properties of Context Feature Models required to represent an adaptive complex event processing system. Document it. (2 weeks)

3. Design of the CFM model for AdaptiveCEP. Document it. (3 weeks)

4. Design of the machine learning approach to predict impact of the quality demands on the configuration types (environmental conditions) for placement in CEP. Document it. (3 weeks)
(interpreted meaning: find a fitting ML approach to 
	- predict the impact of QoS demands (from queries) on ???
(my understanding: ML approach to...
	a) predict the performance of every placement algorithm that can satisfy all constraints imposed by the model for a given context, then select the best one 
	b) train a classifier to select a placement algorithm that maximises performance for a given context
)

5. Prototypical implementation of the designed architecture over the existing AdaptiveCEP system. Document it. (4 weeks)

6. Evaluate the designed solution and compare it. Document it. (4 weeks)

7. Finishing thesis writing (4 weeks)
