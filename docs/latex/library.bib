abstract = {Self-adaptive and dynamic systems adapt their behavior according to the context of execution. The contextual information exhibits multiple variability factors which induce many possible configurations of the software system at runtime. The challenge is to specify the adaptation rules that can link the dynamic variability of the context with the possible variants of the system. Our work investigates the systematic use of feature models for modeling the context and the software variants, together with their inter relations, as a way to configure the adaptive system with respect to a particular context. A case study in the domain of video surveillance systems is used to illustrate the approach.},

abstract = {The idea to build systems based on services, by reusing and combining software made available independently via different technologies and channels and dynamically organizing them into coherent processes, has a very well recognized potential. Achieving this potential stands crucially on the ability to recognize and exploit the context in which such applications operate, in terms of the available services, of the actual setup at run-time, and of the interaction with human actors. Changing contexts require run-time reaction, by adapting the ongoing overall process enacted by the service-based system to unexpected deviations. Continuous context-aware adaptation is hencefore a strong requirement in this setting. In this paper, we propose a service delivery platform designed for the continuous context-aware adaptation of service-based systems, based on the idea of monitoring the underlying context via a hierarchical model, and using the context to drive the choice and execution of adaptive pervasive flows. We describe the approach through an example from the smart cities e-mobility domain. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Connecting a set of UAVs with each other within a Wireless Mesh Network helps to increase the coverage of the observable area. Due to their limited performance and energy resources and, thereby, restricted communication capabilities, a tailored QoS management scheme has to be used to optimize occurring data flows in these networks.We present a QoS control scheme that works on the basis of process-patterns, each describ- ing the context-dependent behavior of UAVs according to the execution order of services for different situations. Furthermore, the logical communication path is optimized within the mesh network based on each node's areal position using a dynamic hierarchical communication structure.

abstract = {Ubiquitous Information Systems (ISs) should support mobility of users and reason efficiently on their context to provide relevant and real-time information. ISs should be particularly adaptive and context-aware by managing and responding properly to occurring events. A need of integrating an adaptive and distributed event based system raises to lead to a diversity of proposed approaches and architectures. Unfortunately, the high level link between context and events is not explicitly considered in these systems. In this paper, we propose a metamodel coupling context and event metadata. The metamodel highlights some requirements considered in the definition of an event processing architecture to maximize communication security between distributed components. Context-aware event processing is a natural result of such architecture enabling the integration of context reasoning in event based systems. The proposal is used to implement an assistant prototype for passengers in the public transportation domain.},

Although there have been significant advances in context-aware systems, there is still a lack of approaches that model and implement context-aware proactive applications involving the combination of context and distributed events. In this paper we address these issues by defining a context-aware event model, a new context-aware publish subscribe scheme and a distributed event-based framework. Our proposed event model is implemented as a context-aware distributed event-based framework that provides the necessary infrastructure to publish and deliver events based on a component's context. In summary, we are able to leverage context as part of our event model and bring behaviour context-aware adaptation to publication and subscription of events. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is of increasing importance in many industrial applications to integrate a huge number of events in a scalable manner. A core challenge towards scalable CEP is to efficiently distribute the rules which define how correlations between events can be detected within an event processing network. Although significant progress has been made recently, there remains a fundamental gap in supporting requirements that emerge from deploying CEP over heterogeneous and independent processing environments. Heterogeneity typically imposes many constraints on the placement of rules, which increases the complexity of the underlying optimization problem and cannot be handled efficiently by existing solutions. In this paper we examine the distributed placement, migration and optimization of rules in the context of the constraint optimization problem to minimize network usage. We propose and evaluate a placement algorithm that efficiently finds valid solutions in scenarios where the solution space is heavily restricted by constraints. The algorithm operates in a decentralized way and is adaptive to dynamic changes of processing nodes, rules, and load characteristics of the event processing network. The proposed rule migration policies resolve invalid placements quickly and thus ensure high availability. The evaluations show that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently find near optimum solutions within heavy constraint-driven network conditions.},

CFM allow for specifying configuration choices of software systems incorporating multiple instances (copies) of features, e.g., for tailoring customer-specific and even potentially unrestricted application resources. Nevertheless, the improved expressiveness of CFM compared to FODA feature models complicates configuration semantics, including sub-tree cloning and potentially unbounded configuration spaces. As a consequence, entirely novel anomalies might arise such as dead cardinality intervals, false unboundedness, and cardinality gaps, which are not properly treated by recent feature-modeling tools. In this paper, we present comprehensive tool support for assisting specification, validation, and configuration of CFM. Our tool CardyGAn, therefore, incorporates capabilities for CFM editing, automated CFM validation including anomaly detection based on a combination of ILP and SMT solvers, as well as a CFM configuration engine based on Alloy. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

These processes include, inter alia, context modeling and reasoning as well as adaptation. In [1], we presented an approach that consists of context modeling and reasoning hand in hand based on relational concept analysis and descriptive logic, respectively. An essential aspect that is often neglected in context modeling and also triggers adaptation is the context variability. In this paper, we propose an approach that lies to answer this matter based on software product line. Our approach creates a semantic link between a context RCA-based model and a feature model, and uses the MAPE-K adaptation loop to determine the appropriate SPL configurations to deploy with regards to context changes. Thus, we used ontology to represent a combined context and feature model. Thereafter, the reasoning is done via descriptive logic. We also defined context rules based on SWRL and applied them to valid SPL configurations. Furthermore, we implemented the MAPE-K adaptation loop with Prolog.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Complex event processing (CEP) is a fundamental paradigm for a software system to self-adapt to environmental changes. CEP provides efficient means to detect (complex) events corresponding to environmental changes by performing a real-time analysis on many, possibly heterogeneous, data sources. The way current CEP systems detect events is determined at design time without accounting for dynamic changes of the environment monitored by the CEP system. This can lead to situations where the performance, quality and reliability of event detection significantly drop (e.g., due to mobility) since initial assumptions of the environment are violated or stated too general. In this paper, we propose A DAPTIVE CEP, a CEP system that is able to self-adapt to detected changes in environmental conditions. We propose a CEP query language that allows specifying changes in the behavior of the CEP system and its mechanisms in detecting events dependent on environmental conditions. This way, A DAPTIVE CEP can select the best-suited configurations for given quality demands. In our evaluation, we show by means of a reference concept how the flexibility exposed by the query language helps to achieve significant performance gains.},

They are used in various environments and have to dynamically adapt themselves accordingly in order to provide an optimal runtime behavior. Naturally, adapting to continuously changing environmental conditions is a challenging task because mobile devices are always limited in their resources and have to adapt in real-time. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables resource limited devices to adapt to changing conditions using dynamic software product lines techniques. Therefore, feature models are reduced to a specific hardware context before installing the adaptive mobile application on the device. This reduces the amount of possible configurations that are compatible with the device and, thereby, minimizes the costs and the duration of an adaptation during runtime.},

However, these methods require the user to provide a priori estimations of the number of clusters and their approximate location in the parameter space. Often these estimations can be made based on some prior understanding about the nature of the data. Alternatively, the user makes these estimations based on visualization of the data. However, the latter is problematic in data sets with large numbers of dimensions. Presented here is an algorithm that can automatically provide these estimates without human intervention based on the inherent structure of the data set. The number of dimensions does not limit it. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Distributed data stream processing systems, like Twitter Storm or Yahoo! S4, have been primarily focusing on adapting to varying event rates. However, as these systems are becoming increasingly multi-tenant, adaptation to the varying query load is becoming an equally important problem. In this paper we present FUGU â€“ an elastic allocator for Complex Event Processing systems. FUGU uses bin packing to allocate continuous queries to a varying set of nodes. Driven by elasticity requirements FUGU maximizes the overall system utilization while trying to maintain stable processing latencies. The specific contributions of this paper are: (1) introduc- tion of a re-balancing scheme for bin packing allowing FUGU to increase overall system utilization by six percent and (2) a detailed study of achievable system utilization and latency under real-life workload from Frankfurt Stock Exchange.},

abstract = {â€”Distributed stream processing relies on in-network operator placement to achieve an optimal resource allocation which can use the pool of machines and network resource efficiently. Due to the QoS (Quality of Service) constraints imposed by the application, operator placement is usually treated as an optimization problem with constraints. Trying to get a global optimization is challenging since it's a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formalize the operator placement problem with network usage as the optimization objective and use two resource allocation related QoS metrics: throughput and end-to-end delay. We propose a concept of Optimization Power to describe the host's capacity to reach a global optimal solution as soon as possible. We also propose a corresponding Optimization Power-based heuristic algorithm for operator placement. Experiment results show that our approach can achieve a better performance in terms of reducing network usage and end-top-end delay, improving success ratio, and decreasing resource discovery frequency, compared to some other placement algorithms.},

abstract = {? 2016 ACM.Smart City applications often use event processing techniques to detect coarse-grained events and situations from fine-grained events of the physical and social world. They operate in dynamic environments in which the properties of underlying resources and streams need to be constantly updated according to changes and events in the real world (e.g. sensor readings, network availability, weather conditions, and temperature). In most of the existing solutions matchmaking between the requirements expressed by event consumers and available event providers is carried out at design-time. This approach is often far from optimal and its deficiencies become even more obvious in smart city scenarios due to their inherently dynamic stream properties. In this paper we discuss a solution for quality-aware adaptive complex event processing using a service-oriented approach. We detail the automatic adaption strategies and evaluate them in a smart city scenario with both real and synthesised datasets.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

Context information is gathered from a variety of sources that differ in the quality of information they produce and that are often failure prone. The pervasive computing community increasingly understands that developing context-aware applications should be supported by adequate context information modelling and reasoning techniques. These techniques reduce the complexity of context-aware applications and improve their maintainability and evolvability. In this paper we discuss the requirements that context modelling and reasoning techniques should meet, including the modelling of a variety of context information types and their relationships, of high-level context abstractions describing real world situations using context information facts, of histories of context information, and of uncertainty of context information. This discussion is followed by a description and comparison of current context modelling and reasoning techniques and a lesson learned from this comparison. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Evolvability is considered as the capability of a system to change its behaviour, i.e. its internal status and/or parameters, according to different production contexts. The SLPS approach is intended to confer evolvable capabilities to a manufacturing production system by enhancing its monitoring and control solutions with context-awareness and data mining techniques. The key assumption is that the deep use of context-awareness and data mining techniques to extract, analyse, and process relevant data generated during production activities will ensure system adaptation.

abstract = {In-network query processing is critical for reducing network traffic when accessing and manipulating sensor data. It requires placing a tree of query operators such as filters and aggregations but also correlations onto sensor nodes in order to minimize the amount of data transmitted in the network. In this paper, we show that this problem is a variant of the task assignment problem for which polynomial algorithms have been developed. These algorithms are however centralized and cannot be used in a sensor network. We describe an adaptive and decentralized algorithm that progressively refines the placement of operators by walking through neighbor nodes. Simulation results illustrate the potential benefits of our approach. They also show that our placement strategy can achieve near optimal placement onto various graph topologies despite the risks of local minima.},

In this light, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a way to build self-managing systems exploiting traditional product line engineering concepts at runtime. Although context-awareness is widely perceived to be a firstclass concern in such runtime variability mechanisms, existing approaches do not provide the necessary level of formalization to model and enact context variability for DSPLs. This is crucial for operational analytics processes since variant configuration could differ from context to context depending on diverse data values linked to context features and cross-tree constraints in a feature model. In this paper, we propose a context variability modeling approach, demonstrate its applicability and usability via a wind farm use case, and present the fundamental building blocks of a framework for enabling context variability in service-based DSPLs which provide Workflow as a Service (WFaaS).

We present the design and implementation of a context-aware framework that uses a probabilistic approach to overcome these deficiencies. The framework utilizes context sensing and machine learning to automatically classify contexts according to their security and privacy-related properties. We apply the framework to two important smartphone-related use cases: protection against device misuse using a dynamic device lock and protection against sensory malware. We ground our analysis on a sociological survey examining the perceptions and concerns of users related to contextual smartphone security and analyze the effectiveness of our approach with real-world context data. We also demonstrate the integration of our framework with the FlaskDroid architecture for fine-grained access control enforcement on the Android platform.},

In order to utilize network resources efficiently and allow for the parallel deployment of a large number of large-scale operator networks, suitable placement algorithms are vital that place operators on physical nodes. In this paper, we present a distributed placement algorithm that minimizes the bandwidth-delay product of data streams between operators of the network in order to reduce the induced network load. Since the fundamental optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic solution. First, we calculate an optimal solution in an intermediate continuous search space, called latency space. Subsequently the continuous solution is mapped to the physical network. Our evaluations show that this algorithm reduces the resulting network load significantly compared to state of the art algorithms and achieves results close to the optimum.},

To better support these scenarios, the CEP middleware can be internally built around several, distributed processors, which cooperate to provide the processing and routing service. This paper introduces and compares different deployment strategies for a CEP middleware, which define (i) how the processing load is distributed over different processors and (ii) how these processors interact to produce the required results and to deliver them to sinks. Our evaluation compares the presented solutions and shows their benefits with respect to a centralized deployment, both in terms of network traffic and in terms of forwarding delay.},

They are used in various environments and have to dynamically adapt themselves accordingly in order to provide an optimal runtime behavior. Naturally, adapting to continuously changing environmental conditions is a challenging task because mobile devices are always limited in their resources and have to adapt in real-time. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables resource limited devices to adapt to changing conditions using dynamic software product lines techniques. Therefore, feature models are reduced to a specific hardware context before installing the adaptive mobile application on the device. This reduces the amount of possible configurations that are compatible with the device and, thereby, minimizes the costs and the duration of an adaptation during runtime.},

These processes include, inter alia, context modeling and reasoning as well as adaptation. In [1], we presented an approach that consists of context modeling and reasoning hand in hand based on relational concept analysis and descriptive logic, respectively. An essential aspect that is often neglected in context modeling and also triggers adaptation is the context variability. In this paper, we propose an approach that lies to answer this matter based on software product line. Our approach creates a semantic link between a context RCA-based model and a feature model, and uses the MAPE-K adaptation loop to determine the appropriate SPL configurations to deploy with regards to context changes. Thus, we used ontology to represent a combined context and feature model. Thereafter, the reasoning is done via descriptive logic. We also defined context rules based on SWRL and applied them to valid SPL configurations. Furthermore, we implemented the MAPE-K adaptation loop with Prolog.},

In order to utilize network resources efficiently and allow for the parallel deployment of a large number of large-scale operator networks, suitable placement algorithms are vital that place operators on physical nodes. In this paper, we present a distributed placement algorithm that minimizes the bandwidth-delay product of data streams between operators of the network in order to reduce the induced network load. Since the fundamental optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic solution. First, we calculate an optimal solution in an intermediate continuous search space, called latency space. Subsequently the continuous solution is mapped to the physical network. Our evaluations show that this algorithm reduces the resulting network load significantly compared to state of the art algorithms and achieves results close to the optimum.},

abstract = {The idea to build systems based on services, by reusing and combining software made available independently via different technologies and channels and dynamically organizing them into coherent processes, has a very well recognized potential. Achieving this potential stands crucially on the ability to recognize and exploit the context in which such applications operate, in terms of the available services, of the actual setup at run-time, and of the interaction with human actors. Changing contexts require run-time reaction, by adapting the ongoing overall process enacted by the service-based system to unexpected deviations. Continuous context-aware adaptation is hencefore a strong requirement in this setting. In this paper, we propose a service delivery platform designed for the continuous context-aware adaptation of service-based systems, based on the idea of monitoring the underlying context via a hierarchical model, and using the context to drive the choice and execution of adaptive pervasive flows. We describe the approach through an example from the smart cities e-mobility domain. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is of increasing importance in many industrial applications to integrate a huge number of events in a scalable manner. A core challenge towards scalable CEP is to efficiently distribute the rules which define how correlations between events can be detected within an event processing network. Although significant progress has been made recently, there remains a fundamental gap in supporting requirements that emerge from deploying CEP over heterogeneous and independent processing environments. Heterogeneity typically imposes many constraints on the placement of rules, which increases the complexity of the underlying optimization problem and cannot be handled efficiently by existing solutions. In this paper we examine the distributed placement, migration and optimization of rules in the context of the constraint optimization problem to minimize network usage. We propose and evaluate a placement algorithm that efficiently finds valid solutions in scenarios where the solution space is heavily restricted by constraints. The algorithm operates in a decentralized way and is adaptive to dynamic changes of processing nodes, rules, and load characteristics of the event processing network. The proposed rule migration policies resolve invalid placements quickly and thus ensure high availability. The evaluations show that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently find near optimum solutions within heavy constraint-driven network conditions.},

In this light, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a way to build self-managing systems exploiting traditional product line engineering concepts at runtime. Although context-awareness is widely perceived to be a firstclass concern in such runtime variability mechanisms, existing approaches do not provide the necessary level of formalization to model and enact context variability for DSPLs. This is crucial for operational analytics processes since variant configuration could differ from context to context depending on diverse data values linked to context features and cross-tree constraints in a feature model. In this paper, we propose a context variability modeling approach, demonstrate its applicability and usability via a wind farm use case, and present the fundamental building blocks of a framework for enabling context variability in service-based DSPLs which provide Workflow as a Service (WFaaS).

They operate in dynamic environments in which the properties of underlying resources and streams need to be constantly updated according to changes and events in the real world (e.g. sensor readings, network availability, weather conditions, and temperature). In most of the existing solutions matchmaking between the requirements expressed by event consumers and available event providers is carried out at design-time. This approach is often far from optimal and its deficiencies become even more obvious in smart city scenarios due to their inherently dynamic stream properties.

Unfortunately, the high level link between context and events is not explicitly considered in these systems. In this paper, we propose a metamodel coupling context and event metadata. The metamodel highlights some requirements considered in the definition of an event processing architecture to maximize communication security between distributed components.

To better support these scenarios, the CEP middleware can be internally built around several, distributed processors, which cooperate to provide the processing and routing service.

abstract = {In-network query processing is critical for reducing network traffic when accessing and manipulating sensor data. It requires placing a tree of query operators such as filters and aggregations but also correlations onto sensor nodes in order to minimize the amount of data transmitted in the network. In this paper, we show that this problem is a variant of the task assignment problem for which polynomial algorithms have been developed. These algorithms are however centralized and cannot be used in a sensor network. We describe an adaptive and decentralized algorithm that progressively refines the placement of operators by walking through neighbor nodes. Simulation results illustrate the potential benefits of our approach. They also show that our placement strategy can achieve near optimal placement onto various graph topologies despite the risks of local minima.},

Evolvability is considered as the capability of a system to change its behaviour, i.e. its internal status and/or parameters, according to different production contexts. The SLPS approach is intended to confer evolvable capabilities to a manufacturing production system by enhancing its monitoring and control solutions with context-awareness and data mining techniques. The key assumption is that the deep use of context-awareness and data mining techniques to extract, analyse, and process relevant data generated during production activities will ensure system adaptation. Current work is an effort to systematize the technical and theoretical developments in the context of SLPS in order to provide the baseline upon which SLPS solutions can be built.},

Due to their limited performance and energy resources and, thereby, restricted communication capabilities, a tailored QoS management scheme has to be used to optimize occurring data flows in these networks.We present a QoS control scheme that works on the basis of process-patterns, each describ- ing the context-dependent behavior of UAVs according to the execution order of services for different situations. Furthermore, the logical communication path is optimized within the mesh network based on each node's areal position using a dynamic hierarchical communication structure.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Complex event processing (CEP) is a fundamental paradigm for a software system to self-adapt to environmental changes. CEP provides efficient means to detect (complex) events corresponding to environmental changes by performing a real-time analysis on many, possibly heterogeneous, data sources. The way current CEP systems detect events is determined at design time without accounting for dynamic changes of the environment monitored by the CEP system. This can lead to situations where the performance, quality and reliability of event detection significantly drop (e.g., due to mobility) since initial assumptions of the environment are violated or stated too general. In this paper, we propose A DAPTIVE CEP, a CEP system that is able to self-adapt to detected changes in environmental conditions. We propose a CEP query language that allows specifying changes in the behavior of the CEP system and its mechanisms in detecting events dependent on environmental conditions. This way, A DAPTIVE CEP can select the best-suited configurations for given quality demands. In our evaluation, we show by means of a reference concept how the flexibility exposed by the query language helps to achieve significant performance gains.},

The variability dimensions identified are modeled using domain-specific languages (DSMLs) tai- lored to adaptive middleware technologies that provide sup- port for runtime variability according to reconfiguration policies.

We assess their decision overhead and memory consumption theoretically and practically in a number of experiments on different hardware platforms. Decision Diagrams turn out to be more compact compared to Dispatch Tables, almost as accurate, and faster in decision making. Using Decision Diagrams in Context-Aware Composition leads to a better scal-ability, i.e., Context-Aware Composition can be applied at more program points and regard more context attributes than before.},

Although there have been significant advances in context-aware systems, there is still a lack of approaches that model and implement context-aware proactive applications involving the combination of context and distributed events. In this paper we address these issues by defining a context-aware event model, a new context-aware publish subscribe scheme and a distributed event-based framework. Our proposed event model is implemented as a context-aware distributed event-based framework that provides the necessary infrastructure to publish and deliver events based on a component's context. In summary, we are able to leverage context as part of our event model and bring behaviour context-aware adaptation to publication and subscription of events. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

CFM allow for specifying configuration choices of software systems incorporating multiple instances (copies) of features, e.g., for tailoring customer-specific and even potentially unrestricted application resources. Nevertheless, the improved expressiveness of CFM compared to FODA feature models complicates configuration semantics, including sub-tree cloning and potentially unbounded configuration spaces. As a consequence, entirely novel anomalies might arise such as dead cardinality intervals, false unboundedness, and cardinality gaps, which are not properly treated by recent feature-modeling tools. In this paper, we present comprehensive tool support for assisting specification, validation, and configuration of CFM. Our tool CardyGAn, therefore, incorporates capabilities for CFM editing, automated CFM validation including anomaly detection based on a combination of ILP and SMT solvers, as well as a CFM configuration engine based on Alloy. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

The pervasive computing community increasingly understands that developing context-aware applications should be supported by adequate context information modelling and reasoning techniques. These techniques reduce the complexity of context-aware applications and improve their maintainability and evolvability. In this paper we discuss the requirements that context modelling and reasoning techniques should meet, including the modelling of a variety of context information types and their relationships, of high-level context abstractions describing real world situations using context information facts, of histories of context information, and of uncertainty of context information.

abstract = {â€”Distributed stream processing relies on in-network operator placement to achieve an optimal resource allocation which can use the pool of machines and network resource efficiently. Due to the QoS (Quality of Service) constraints imposed by the application, operator placement is usually treated as an optimization problem with constraints. Trying to get a global optimization is challenging since it's a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formalize the operator placement problem with network usage as the optimization objective and use two resource allocation related QoS metrics: throughput and end-to-end delay. We propose a concept of Optimization Power to describe the host's capacity to reach a global optimal solution as soon as possible. We also propose a corresponding Optimization Power-based heuristic algorithm for operator placement. Experiment results show that our approach can achieve a better performance in terms of reducing network usage and end-top-end delay, improving success ratio, and decreasing resource discovery frequency, compared to some other placement algorithms.},
