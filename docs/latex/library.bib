abstract = {Several complex event processing (CEP) middleware solutions have been proposed in the past. They act by processing primitive events generated by sources, extracting new knowledge in the form of composite events, and delivering them to interested sinks. Event-based applications often involve a large number of sources and sinks, possibly dispersed over a wide geographical area. To better support these scenarios, the CEP middleware can be internally built around several, distributed processors, which cooperate to provide the processing and routing service. This paper introduces and compares different deployment strategies for a CEP middleware, which define (i) how the processing load is distributed over different processors and (ii) how these processors interact to produce the required results and to deliver them to sinks. Our evaluation compares the presented solutions and shows their benefits with respect to a centralized deployment, both in terms of network traffic and in terms of forwarding delay.},

abstract = {Mobile devices like smartphones are getting increasingly important in our daily lifes. They are used in various environments and have to dynamically adapt themselves accordingly in order to provide an optimal runtime behavior. Naturally, adapting to continuously changing environmental conditions is a challenging task because mobile devices are always limited in their resources and have to adapt in real-time. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables resource limited devices to adapt to changing conditions using dynamic software product lines techniques. Therefore, feature models are reduced to a specific hardware context before installing the adaptive mobile application on the device. This reduces the amount of possible configurations that are compatible with the device and, thereby, minimizes the costs and the duration of an adaptation during runtime.},

abstract = {—Distributed stream processing relies on in-network operator placement to achieve an optimal resource allocation which can use the pool of machines and network resource efficiently. Due to the QoS (Quality of Service) constraints imposed by the application, operator placement is usually treated as an optimization problem with constraints. Trying to get a global optimization is challenging since it's a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formalize the operator placement problem with network usage as the optimization objective and use two resource allocation related QoS metrics: throughput and end-to-end delay. We propose a concept of Optimization Power to describe the host's capacity to reach a global optimal solution as soon as possible. We also propose a corresponding Optimization Power-based heuristic algorithm for operator placement. Experiment results show that our approach can achieve a better performance in terms of reducing network usage and end-top-end delay, improving success ratio, and decreasing resource discovery frequency, compared to some other placement algorithms.},

abstract = {Data Stream Processing (DSP) applications are widely used to timely extract information from distributed data sources, such as sensing devices, monitoring stations, and social networks. To successfully handle this ever increasing amount of data, recent trends investigate the possibility of exploiting decentralized computational resources (e.g., Fog computing) to define the applications placement. Several placement policies have been proposed in the literature, but they are based on different assumptions and optimization goals and, as such, they are not completely comparable to each other. In this paper we study the placement problem for distributed DSP applications. Our contributions are twofold. We provide a general formulation of the optimal DSP placement (for short, ODP) as an Integer Linear Programming problem which takes explicitly into account the heterogeneity of computing and networking resources and which encompasses - As special cases - The different solutions proposed in the literature. We present an ODP-based scheduler for the Apache Storm DSP framework. This allows us to compare some well-known centralized and decentralized placement solutions. We also extensively analyze the ODP scalability with respect to various parameter settings. {\&}copy; 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {The idea to build systems based on services, by reusing and combining software made available independently via different technologies and channels and dynamically organizing them into coherent processes, has a very well recognized potential. Achieving this potential stands crucially on the ability to recognize and exploit the context in which such applications operate, in terms of the available services, of the actual setup at run-time, and of the interaction with human actors. Changing contexts require run-time reaction, by adapting the ongoing overall process enacted by the service-based system to unexpected deviations. Continuous context-aware adaptation is hencefore a strong requirement in this setting. In this paper, we propose a service delivery platform designed for the continuous context-aware adaptation of service-based systems, based on the idea of monitoring the underlying context via a hierarchical model, and using the context to drive the choice and execution of adaptive pervasive flows. We describe the approach through an example from the smart cities e-mobility domain. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Context information is gathered from a variety of sources that differ in the quality of information they produce and that are often failure prone. The pervasive computing community increasingly understands that developing context-aware applications should be supported by adequate context information modelling and reasoning techniques. These techniques reduce the complexity of context-aware applications and improve their maintainability and evolvability. In this paper we discuss the requirements that context modelling and reasoning techniques should meet, including the modelling of a variety of context information types and their relationships, of high-level context abstractions describing real world situations using context information facts, of histories of context information, and of uncertainty of context information. This discussion is followed by a description and comparison of current context modelling and reasoning techniques and a lesson learned from this comparison. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Complex event processing (CEP) is a fundamental paradigm for a software system to self-adapt to environmental changes. CEP provides efficient means to detect (complex) events corresponding to environmental changes by performing a real-time analysis on many, possibly heterogeneous, data sources. The way current CEP systems detect events is determined at design time without accounting for dynamic changes of the environment monitored by the CEP system. This can lead to situations where the performance, quality and reliability of event detection significantly drop (e.g., due to mobility) since initial assumptions of the environment are violated or stated too general. In this paper, we propose A DAPTIVE CEP, a CEP system that is able to self-adapt to detected changes in environmental conditions. We propose a CEP query language that allows specifying changes in the behavior of the CEP system and its mechanisms in detecting events dependent on environmental conditions. This way, A DAPTIVE CEP can select the best-suited configurations for given quality demands. In our evaluation, we show by means of a reference concept how the flexibility exposed by the query language helps to achieve significant performance gains.},

In this paper we address these issues by defining a context-aware event model, a new context-aware publish subscribe scheme and a distributed event-based framework. Our proposed event model is implemented as a context-aware distributed event-based framework that provides the necessary infrastructure to publish and deliver events based on a component's context.

abstract = {In emerging domains such as Cloud-based Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) and SCADA systems where data-intensive and high performance computing are needed, a higher degree of flexibility is being demanded to meet new stakeholder requirements, context changes and intrinsic complexity. In this light, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a way to build self-managing systems exploiting traditional product line engineering concepts at runtime. Although context-awareness is widely perceived to be a firstclass concern in such runtime variability mechanisms, existing approaches do not provide the necessary level of formalization to model and enact context variability for DSPLs. This is crucial for operational analytics processes since variant configuration could differ from context to context depending on diverse data values linked to context features and cross-tree constraints in a feature model. In this paper, we propose a context variability modeling approach, demonstrate its applicability and usability via a wind farm use case, and present the fundamental building blocks of a framework for enabling context variability in service-based DSPLs which provide Workflow as a Service (WFaaS).

Due to their limited performance and energy resources and, thereby, restricted communication capabilities, a tailored QoS management scheme has to be used to optimize occurring data flows in these networks.We present a QoS control scheme that works on the basis of process-patterns, each describ- ing the context-dependent behavior of UAVs according to the execution order of services for different situations. Furthermore, the logical communication path is optimized within the mesh network based on each node's areal position using a dynamic hierarchical communication structure.

They operate in dynamic environments in which the properties of underlying resources and streams need to be constantly updated according to changes and events in the real world (e.g. sensor readings, network availability, weather conditions, and temperature). In most of the existing solutions matchmaking between the requirements expressed by event consumers and available event providers is carried out at design-time. This approach is often far from optimal and its deficiencies become even more obvious in smart city scenarios due to their inherently dynamic stream properties. In this paper we discuss a solution for quality-aware adaptive complex event processing using a service-oriented approach. We detail the automatic adaption strategies and evaluate them in a smart city scenario with both real and synthesised datasets.},

abstract = {In sensor networks, data acquisition frequently takes place at low-capability devices. The acquired data is then transmitted through a hierarchy of nodes having progressively increasing network bandwidth and computational power. We consider the problem of executing queries over these data streams, posed at the root of the hierarchy. To minimize data transmission, it is desirable to perform ``in-network'' query processing: do some part of the work at intermediate nodes as the data travels to the root. Most previous work on in-network query processing has focused on aggregation and inexpensive filters. In this paper, we address in-network processing for queries involving possibly expensive conjunctive filters, and joins. We consider the problem of placing operators along the nodes of the hierarchy so that the overall cost of computation and data transmission is minimized. We show that the problem is tractable, give an optimal algorithm, and demonstrate that a simpler greedy operator placement algorithm can fail to find the optimal solution. Finally we define a number of interesting variations of the basic operator placement problem and demonstrate their hardness.},

In order to utilize network resources efficiently and allow for the parallel deployment of a large number of large-scale operator networks, suitable placement algorithms are vital that place operators on physical nodes. In this paper, we present a distributed placement algorithm that minimizes the bandwidth-delay product of data streams between operators of the network in order to reduce the induced network load. Since the fundamental optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic solution. First, we calculate an optimal solution in an intermediate continuous search space, called latency space. Subsequently the continuous solution is mapped to the physical network. Our evaluations show that this algorithm reduces the resulting network load significantly compared to state of the art algorithms and achieves results close to the optimum.},

Examples include intrusion detection systems which analyze network traffic in real-time to identify possible attacks; environmental monitoring applications whichprocess rawdata coming fromsensornetworks to identify critical situations; or applications performing online analysis of stock prices to identify trends and forecast future values. Traditional DBMSs, which need to store and index data before processing it, can hardly fulfill the requirements of timeliness coming from such domains. Accordingly, during the last decade, different re- search communities developed a number of tools, which we collectively call Information flow processing (IFP) systems, to support these scenarios. They differ in their system architecture, data model, rule model, and rule language. In this article, we survey these systems to help researchers, who often come from different backgrounds, in understanding how the various approaches they adopt may complement each other. In particular, we propose a general, unifying model to capture the different aspects of an IFP system and use it to provide a complete and precise classification of the systems and mechanisms proposed so far.},

The key assumption is that the deep use of context-awareness and data mining techniques to extract, analyse, and process relevant data generated during production activities will ensure system adaptation.

These processes include, inter alia, context modeling and reasoning as well as adaptation.

An essential aspect that is often neglected in context modeling and also triggers adaptation is the context variability. In this paper, we propose an approach that lies to answer this matter based on software product line. Our approach creates a semantic link between a context RCA-based model and a feature model, and uses the MAPE-K adaptation loop to determine the appropriate SPL configurations to deploy with regards to context changes. Thus, we used ontology to represent a combined context and feature model. Thereafter, the reasoning is done via descriptive logic. We also defined context rules based on SWRL and applied them to valid SPL configurations. Furthermore, we implemented the MAPE-K adaptation loop with Prolog.},

abstract = {Cardinality-based feature models (CFM) constitute a crucial and non-trivial extension to FODA feature models in terms of UML-like feature multiplicities and corresponding cardinality constraints. CFM allow for specifying configuration choices of software systems incorporating multiple instances (copies) of features, e.g., for tailoring customer-specific and even potentially unrestricted application resources. Nevertheless, the improved expressiveness of CFM compared to FODA feature models complicates configuration semantics, including sub-tree cloning and potentially unbounded configuration spaces. As a consequence, entirely novel anomalies might arise such as dead cardinality intervals, false unboundedness, and cardinality gaps, which are not properly treated by recent feature-modeling tools. In this paper, we present comprehensive tool support for assisting specification, validation, and configuration of CFM. Our tool CardyGAn, therefore, incorporates capabilities for CFM editing, automated CFM validation including anomaly detection based on a combination of ILP and SMT solvers, as well as a CFM configuration engine based on Alloy. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is of increasing importance in many industrial applications to integrate a huge number of events in a scalable manner. A core challenge towards scalable CEP is to efficiently distribute the rules which define how correlations between events can be detected within an event processing network. Although significant progress has been made recently, there remains a fundamental gap in supporting requirements that emerge from deploying CEP over heterogeneous and independent processing environments. Heterogeneity typically imposes many constraints on the placement of rules, which increases the complexity of the underlying optimization problem and cannot be handled efficiently by existing solutions. In this paper we examine the distributed placement, migration and optimization of rules in the context of the constraint optimization problem to minimize network usage. We propose and evaluate a placement algorithm that efficiently finds valid solutions in scenarios where the solution space is heavily restricted by constraints. The algorithm operates in a decentralized way and is adaptive to dynamic changes of processing nodes, rules, and load characteristics of the event processing network. The proposed rule migration policies resolve invalid placements quickly and thus ensure high availability. The evaluations show that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently find near optimum solutions within heavy constraint-driven network conditions.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

abstract = {Several complex event processing (CEP) middleware solutions have been proposed in the past. They act by processing primitive events generated by sources, extracting new knowledge in the form of composite events, and delivering them to interested sinks. Event-based applications often involve a large number of sources and sinks, possibly dispersed over a wide geographical area. To better support these scenarios, the CEP middleware can be internally built around several, distributed processors, which cooperate to provide the processing and routing service. This paper introduces and compares different deployment strategies for a CEP middleware, which define (i) how the processing load is distributed over different processors and (ii) how these processors interact to produce the required results and to deliver them to sinks. Our evaluation compares the presented solutions and shows their benefits with respect to a centralized deployment, both in terms of network traffic and in terms of forwarding delay.},

For example, UAVs are utilized to observe critical areas in disaster situations without jeopardizing individuals or to extend the transmission range of communication networks. Connecting a set of UAVs with each other within a Wireless Mesh Network helps to increase the coverage of the observable area. Due to their limited performance and energy resources and, thereby, restricted communication capabilities, a tailored QoS management scheme has to be used to optimize occurring data flows in these networks.We present a QoS control scheme that works on the basis of process-patterns, each describ- ing the context-dependent behavior of UAVs according to the execution order of services for different situations. Furthermore, the logical communication path is optimized within the mesh network based on each node's areal position using a dynamic hierarchical communication structure. Thereby, performance and fairness within a network of UAVs can be increased demand- actuated.},

abstract = {A large number of distributed applications requires continuous and timely processing of information as it flows from the periphery to the center of the system. Examples include intrusion detection systems which analyze network traffic in real-time to identify possible attacks; environmental monitoring applications whichprocess rawdata coming fromsensornetworks to identify critical situations; or applications performing online analysis of stock prices to identify trends and forecast future values. Traditional DBMSs, which need to store and index data before processing it, can hardly fulfill the requirements of timeliness coming from such domains. Accordingly, during the last decade, different re- search communities developed a number of tools, which we collectively call Information flow processing (IFP) systems, to support these scenarios. They differ in their system architecture, data model, rule model, and rule language. In this article, we survey these systems to help researchers, who often come from different backgrounds, in understanding how the various approaches they adopt may complement each other. In particular, we propose a general, unifying model to capture the different aspects of an IFP system and use it to provide a complete and precise classification of the systems and mechanisms proposed so far.},

abstract = {—Distributed stream processing relies on in-network operator placement to achieve an optimal resource allocation which can use the pool of machines and network resource efficiently. Due to the QoS (Quality of Service) constraints imposed by the application, operator placement is usually treated as an optimization problem with constraints. Trying to get a global optimization is challenging since it's a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formalize the operator placement problem with network usage as the optimization objective and use two resource allocation related QoS metrics: throughput and end-to-end delay. We propose a concept of Optimization Power to describe the host's capacity to reach a global optimal solution as soon as possible. We also propose a corresponding Optimization Power-based heuristic algorithm for operator placement. Experiment results show that our approach can achieve a better performance in terms of reducing network usage and end-top-end delay, improving success ratio, and decreasing resource discovery frequency, compared to some other placement algorithms.},

Evolvability is considered as the capability of a system to change its behaviour, i.e. its internal status and/or parameters, according to different production contexts. The SLPS approach is intended to confer evolvable capabilities to a manufacturing production system by enhancing its monitoring and control solutions with context-awareness and data mining techniques. The key assumption is that the deep use of context-awareness and data mining techniques to extract, analyse, and process relevant data generated during production activities will ensure system adaptation. Current work is an effort to systematize the technical and theoretical developments in the context of SLPS in order to provide the baseline upon which SLPS solutions can be built.},

abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

abstract = {Cardinality-based feature models (CFM) constitute a crucial and non-trivial extension to FODA feature models in terms of UML-like feature multiplicities and corresponding cardinality constraints. CFM allow for specifying configuration choices of software systems incorporating multiple instances (copies) of features, e.g., for tailoring customer-specific and even potentially unrestricted application resources. Nevertheless, the improved expressiveness of CFM compared to FODA feature models complicates configuration semantics, including sub-tree cloning and potentially unbounded configuration spaces. As a consequence, entirely novel anomalies might arise such as dead cardinality intervals, false unboundedness, and cardinality gaps, which are not properly treated by recent feature-modeling tools. In this paper, we present comprehensive tool support for assisting specification, validation, and configuration of CFM. Our tool CardyGAn, therefore, incorporates capabilities for CFM editing, automated CFM validation including anomaly detection based on a combination of ILP and SMT solvers, as well as a CFM configuration engine based on Alloy. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {The idea to build systems based on services, by reusing and combining software made available independently via different technologies and channels and dynamically organizing them into coherent processes, has a very well recognized potential. Achieving this potential stands crucially on the ability to recognize and exploit the context in which such applications operate, in terms of the available services, of the actual setup at run-time, and of the interaction with human actors. Changing contexts require run-time reaction, by adapting the ongoing overall process enacted by the service-based system to unexpected deviations. Continuous context-aware adaptation is hencefore a strong requirement in this setting. In this paper, we propose a service delivery platform designed for the continuous context-aware adaptation of service-based systems, based on the idea of monitoring the underlying context via a hierarchical model, and using the context to drive the choice and execution of adaptive pervasive flows. We describe the approach through an example from the smart cities e-mobility domain. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

They operate in dynamic environments in which the properties of underlying resources and streams need to be constantly updated according to changes and events in the real world (e.g. sensor readings, network availability, weather conditions, and temperature). In most of the existing solutions matchmaking between the requirements expressed by event consumers and available event providers is carried out at design-time. This approach is often far from optimal and its deficiencies become even more obvious in smart city scenarios due to their inherently dynamic stream properties.

We detail the automatic adaption strategies and evaluate them in a smart city scenario with both real and synthesised datasets.},

Decision Diagrams turn out to be more compact compared to Dispatch Tables, almost as accurate, and faster in decision making.

These processes include, inter alia, context modeling and reasoning as well as adaptation. In [1], we presented an approach that consists of context modeling and reasoning hand in hand based on relational concept analysis and descriptive logic, respectively. An essential aspect that is often neglected in context modeling and also triggers adaptation is the context variability. In this paper, we propose an approach that lies to answer this matter based on software product line. Our approach creates a semantic link between a context RCA-based model and a feature model, and uses the MAPE-K adaptation loop to determine the appropriate SPL configurations to deploy with regards to context changes. Thus, we used ontology to represent a combined context and feature model. Thereafter, the reasoning is done via descriptive logic. We also defined context rules based on SWRL and applied them to valid SPL configurations. Furthermore, we implemented the MAPE-K adaptation loop with Prolog.},

In this paper, we present a distributed placement algorithm that minimizes the bandwidth-delay product of data streams between operators of the network in order to reduce the induced network load. Since the fundamental optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic solution. First, we calculate an optimal solution in an intermediate continuous search space, called latency space.

abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is of increasing importance in many industrial applications to integrate a huge number of events in a scalable manner. A core challenge towards scalable CEP is to efficiently distribute the rules which define how correlations between events can be detected within an event processing network. Although significant progress has been made recently, there remains a fundamental gap in supporting requirements that emerge from deploying CEP over heterogeneous and independent processing environments. Heterogeneity typically imposes many constraints on the placement of rules, which increases the complexity of the underlying optimization problem and cannot be handled efficiently by existing solutions. In this paper we examine the distributed placement, migration and optimization of rules in the context of the constraint optimization problem to minimize network usage. We propose and evaluate a placement algorithm that efficiently finds valid solutions in scenarios where the solution space is heavily restricted by constraints. The algorithm operates in a decentralized way and is adaptive to dynamic changes of processing nodes, rules, and load characteristics of the event processing network. The proposed rule migration policies resolve invalid placements quickly and thus ensure high availability. The evaluations show that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently find near optimum solutions within heavy constraint-driven network conditions.},

ISs should be particularly adaptive and context-aware by managing and responding properly to occurring events. A need of integrating an adaptive and distributed event based system raises to lead to a diversity of proposed approaches and architectures. Unfortunately, the high level link between context and events is not explicitly considered in these systems. In this paper, we propose a metamodel coupling context and event metadata. The metamodel highlights some requirements considered in the definition of an event processing architecture to maximize communication security between distributed components. Context-aware event processing is a natural result of such architecture enabling the integration of context reasoning in event based systems.

abstract = {Context-aware systems offer entirely new opportunities for application developers and for end users by gathering context data and adapting systems behaviour accordingly. Especially in combination with mobile devices these mechanisms are of high value and are used to increase usability tremendously. In this paper, we present common architecture principles of context-aware systems and derive a layered conceptual design framework to explain the different elements common to most context-aware architectures. Based on these design principles, we introduce various existing context-aware systems focusing on context-aware middleware and frameworks, which ease the development of context-aware applications. We discuss various approaches and analyse important aspects in context-aware computing on the basis of the presented systems. Technology (TU Wien).

@article{Weisenburger2017b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Complex event processing (CEP) is a fundamental paradigm for a software system to self-adapt to environmental changes. CEP provides efficient means to detect (complex) events corresponding to environmental changes by performing a real-time analysis on many, possibly heterogeneous, data sources. The way current CEP systems detect events is determined at design time without accounting for dynamic changes of the environment monitored by the CEP system. This can lead to situations where the performance, quality and reliability of event detection significantly drop (e.g., due to mobility) since initial assumptions of the environment are violated or stated too general. In this paper, we propose A DAPTIVE CEP, a CEP system that is able to self-adapt to detected changes in environmental conditions. We propose a CEP query language that allows specifying changes in the behavior of the CEP system and its mechanisms in detecting events dependent on environmental conditions. This way, A DAPTIVE CEP can select the best-suited configurations for given quality demands. In our evaluation, we show by means of a reference concept how the flexibility exposed by the query language helps to achieve significant performance gains.},

abstract = {In emerging domains such as Cloud-based Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) and SCADA systems where data-intensive and high performance computing are needed, a higher degree of flexibility is being demanded to meet new stakeholder requirements, context changes and intrinsic complexity. In this light, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a way to build self-managing systems exploiting traditional product line engineering concepts at runtime. Although context-awareness is widely perceived to be a firstclass concern in such runtime variability mechanisms, existing approaches do not provide the necessary level of formalization to model and enact context variability for DSPLs. This is crucial for operational analytics processes since variant configuration could differ from context to context depending on diverse data values linked to context features and cross-tree constraints in a feature model. In this paper, we propose a context variability modeling approach, demonstrate its applicability and usability via a wind farm use case, and present the fundamental building blocks of a framework for enabling context variability in service-based DSPLs which provide Workflow as a Service (WFaaS).

@article{Saller2012,
abstract = {Mobile devices like smartphones are getting increasingly important in our daily lifes. They are used in various environments and have to dynamically adapt themselves accordingly in order to provide an optimal runtime behavior. Naturally, adapting to continuously changing environmental conditions is a challenging task because mobile devices are always limited in their resources and have to adapt in real-time. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables resource limited devices to adapt to changing conditions using dynamic software product lines techniques. Therefore, feature models are reduced to a specific hardware context before installing the adaptive mobile application on the device. This reduces the amount of possible configurations that are compatible with the device and, thereby, minimizes the costs and the duration of an adaptation during runtime.},
