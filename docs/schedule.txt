Month	Goals
========================================================================================================================
1		- write introduction, background + related work (on DSPLs and context-based adaptation in EPS) chapters 
(15.11.-15.12.)	- set up and look into existing AdaptiveCEP code base 
	
2		- design of the CFM: requirement analysis w.r.t. AdaptiveCEP, model design and justification of choices
(16.12.-15.1.)	- design of mechanism transition  approach + idea how to implement it
		- basic implementation of the model into AdaptiveCEP, including necessary adaptations of code base
	
3		- finish implementation of CFM and implement mechanism transition approach
(16.1.-15.2.)	- test implementation, bug fixes etc.
		- formulate simulation/evaluation goals
 		- design simulation scenario, basic setup of simulation
		- finalize introduction, background + related work
	
4		- begin evaluation, adapt implementation (or design) as necessary
(16.2.-15.3.)	- further, more involved simulations
		- finalize design and implementation chapters
	
5	
(16.3.- 1.4.)	- analyze evaluation results in detail
		- extend and finalize evaluation chapter
	
6		- complete thesis document
(2.4.-30.4.)	- revise thesis document
		- prepare presentation
